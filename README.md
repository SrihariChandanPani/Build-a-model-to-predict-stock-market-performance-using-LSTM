Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.
LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is well suited for time-series forecasting, as it can learn long-term dependencies from historical stock data.
The model is trained on past stock prices to predict future closing prices and evaluate performance using standard regression metrics.

Objective:
To analyze historical stock market data
To build an LSTM-based deep learning model
To predict future stock closing prices
To evaluate the model using MAE, RMSE, and R² score

Dataset:
Source- Kaggle

Features Used:
Date
Open
High
Low
Close
Only the Close price is used for prediction.

Results:
The model successfully captures stock price trends
Predicted prices closely follow actual prices
Suitable for educational and demonstration purposes
